In 1969 the poet Jan Erik Vold released a poem collection called
 "Kykelipi", in which he wrote a poem containing 23 permutations
of the word "Kulturuke". He, however, failed to realise that
there exists 30240 permutations of that word. I have therefore
taken upon myself to correct his poem by adding the 30217
permutations he missed.
